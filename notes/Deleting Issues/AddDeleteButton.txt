First step in implementing the delete issue feature
 add a delete button on the issue details page

Id folder go to page create DeleteIssueButton.tsx
Create a separate component for the whole button
Similar to how we made the edit issue button
rafce

 this component should also take the issue ID as a prop
 can Define it inline grab issueId  from an object where we have issue ID of type number
 add a button component from Radix UI
Set color red, label to Delete Issue

 then we can import delete issue button on the page
 pass the issueId as issue.id
 buttons are inline in HTML
Flex container from radix ui (or div flex) direction=’column’ gap=”4”

 currently our button takes up 50% bc we have 2 columns
 if we change it to five columns, 
we can allocate 4 to the issue details and 1 to the buttons
On the detail box set className=’col-span-4’
The “prose” class we set-  Max width is being set to the components
	 limits our characters to 65 and improves readability
Add max-w-full to allow the card to stretch and take available space

 on mobile devices in a single column we will want to take up the full width and not apply the column span
 if we prefix something in Tailwind with a size it only comes up at that size or larger
Lg:col-span-4
 *note, medium in Radix UI is equivalent to large in Tailwind

 on tablets the buttons are really wide, so we can apply a two-column layout there
 so change our grid columns to small and are box to medium (down 1 size)

 we can use a container component and Radix UI to apply a Max width to our page to avoid growing too large
 in the layout, inside main we can wrap the children
*not using the container from postcss
