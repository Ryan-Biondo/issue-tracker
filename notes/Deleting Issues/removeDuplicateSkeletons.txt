 because the loading route for new is inside the route for issues which also has a loading page it loads one before the other
 the loading files should be overriding each other so this could be a bug, so for this instance we will break the hierarchy

 create a new folder in the issues folder called list
 move all of the root files for issues into list
 now we have to update the link to the issues page

 update our Link in the nav bar from issues to issues/list
 find all instances of where we used router.push

 another hierarchy we should flatten is the edit folder inside the ID folder
 move the edit folder into the ID group folder
 add a new folder called ID and move the root files there
 now we don't have any parent loading files

 edit the URL in the edit issue button
{`/issues/edit/${issueId}`}
