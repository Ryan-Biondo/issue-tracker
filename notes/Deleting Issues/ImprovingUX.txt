Show a spinner while being deleted

Inside the api/issues/[id] route
Add a delay of 2000 milliseconds and awaited
if there is a delay there's two things we need to do, disable the delete button, and add a spinner

 go back to the delete issue button and create a state variable initialized to false
 call it isDeleting setDeleting
Try{
 setDeleting(true)
 if something goes wrong, and the catch set delete to false
 
 on the delete button, add a disabled property
disabled={isDeleting}
 then inside the button label, render a spinner only if is deleting is true
{isDeleting && <Spinner />}

Remove the delay from route before continuing
Organize imports
