 the API is ready, so to delete an issue we need to set up the button
this will be on the confirm deletion button

 handle an onclick event
 we can use inline functions for small functions 
but as functions get more complex it's better to move them outside as a variable

 on click will be an arrow function that calls axios.delete and provides the endpoint
axios.delete(‘/api/issues/’ + issueId) or `/api/issues/${issueId}`
 await the call and make it async

 next use the next JS router to send the user back to the issues page
 make sure to import the new one from next/navigation
Const router = useRouter() to get access to the router hook
 then after we delete we can say router.push(‘issues’)

Call router.refresh() to update the cache
