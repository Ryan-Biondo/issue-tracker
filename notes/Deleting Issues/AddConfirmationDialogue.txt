 we need to show a dialog box when the button is clicked to confirm deletion
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/alert-dialog
 basically wrap our button in the alert dialog box inside the trigger

 we cannot access alert Dialogue on the server because we need user interaction 
so we have to convert this to a client component

 to keep the buttons horizontal put them in a flex container as shown in the example
Apply the gap and mt
Wrap cancel in cancel
Ok in ‘action’
