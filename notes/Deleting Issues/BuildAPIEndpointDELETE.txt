Delete
Build api endpoint
Go to [id] folder in the route
Before we did a function for updating (PATCH) now we will do a delete

Copy the params of PATCH change to delete - same parameters
 we have to fetch the issue with the given ID so call prisma.issue.findunique()
 pass a where object  set it to ID to parseint of params.id
 await the call to get the issue constant

 if issue doesn't exist return a 404 error
If (!issue)
 Return NextResponse.json({error: ‘Invalid issue’}, {status: 404}

 otherwise we delete, await prisma.issue.delete({
Where: {id: issue.id }

Return an empty response to the client
Return NextResponse.json({})
 test a delete request to the API endpoint in Postman
