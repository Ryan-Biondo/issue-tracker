Paginating issues
Go to the issues list page and add page: string
 all search parameters are string values we have to parse them into other types of objects if we need
    const page = parseInt(searchParams.page) || 1;
    const pageSize = 10;
 then we can set the value to one if there is no page and we can hard code a page size
 in the future we can implement a drop-down menu to change the page size

 we  can add extra properties here like skip
# of records we should skip (so arent refetching the first pages or all the data)
skip: (page - 1) * pageSize,
and take - # we want to fetch (so we only fetch the page worth of data)

 we need to know the total number of issues so we can pass it to the pagination component
const issueCount = await prisma.issue.count({
    where: {
      status,
    },
  });
 we can reduce this down because we repeat the where object so store it in a constant
 const where = { status };

 the pagination component will go at the bottom of our table
 <Pagination
        pageSize={pageSize}
        currentPage={page}
        itemCount={issueCount}
      />
 now we should be able to navigate between Pages while they're filtered even

 this component has a lot of logic in it, and it's Focus as a page component should be to lay out the other components 
so we should separate some out
