sorting issues
to sort, when we call the findMany method, add the orderBy property
set to an object
 include the property you want to sort by, and this case title status and created at
 we can say them all at once by putting them in a array
 we get a crash when we try to filter  because we haven't added our order by key to our Prisma object 
 we need to create a constant to check if  the order by property exists
  const orderBy = searchParams.orderBy
    ? { [searchParams.orderBy]: 'asc' }
    : undefined;
 then we can remove the object definition and just call the object in our find many method

 we crash if we have an invalid property names, so we have to validate the URL
 the order by parameters should be set to only one value at a time so we can check to see if it's one of those
 we can't check columns.include because it expects a column object
 we need to map each column to its value
  const orderBy = columns
    .map((column) => column.value)
    .includes(searchParams.orderBy)
    ? { [searchParams.orderBy]: 'asc' }
    : undefined;
