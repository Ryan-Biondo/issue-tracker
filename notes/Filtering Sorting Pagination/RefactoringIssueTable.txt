Issue table violates srp
 move the table into a new component
 get All Imports, and manually get the next link import
 import the issue model from Prisma client
 then we need to move data like the columns, issue array, and the search params

 Define an interface for props we need search params of type,
 import the status model
 add the issue property of type issue array
interface Props {
  searchParams: { status: Status; orderBy: keyof Issue; page: string };
  issues: Issue[];
}

<IssueTable searchParams={searchParams} issues={issues} />
include this in our page

 we need the column array in both components,
 we can export the logic so that both can use them.
 But we have logic that's specific to the issue table that we shouldn't expose
like classnames and labels
(would violate encapsulation principle)
 instead, export a constant called column names when we map the columns to each column value
export const columnNames = columns.map((column) => column.value);
then we can replace
columns
    .map((column) => column.value)
with columnNames

 currently we duplicate our search params
 because this page is dependent on the issue table we should move the definition of the interface into the issue table and reuse it in both spots
export interface IssueQuery {
  status: Status;
  orderBy: keyof Issue;
  page: string;
}


interface Props {
  searchParams: IssueQuery;
  issues: Issue[];
}

replace our page layourt with Flex
 at a gap and make a direction column
 remove the bottom margin from the issue actions component
