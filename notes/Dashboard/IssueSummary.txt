 we want to create three cards horizontally that show the number of issues for a given status
 to avoid creating three separate cards we can lay out our information in an array first
 pass the props of open in progress and closed to the statuses so that we can get them from outside

 we want to create a new property called status to send the user to the issue list page and apply a filter for the status
 we can annotate our status's object with an object array  and specify status as a status from Prisma client
 then they can only be one of our valid statuses like IN_PROGRESS

 style the components with gaps and text size
 go back in the homepage and call Prisma to get the count
const open = await prisma.issue.count({ where: { status: 'OPEN' } });
 then use those variables instead of hardcoded values
