 to build the chart component, we're going to use recharts
https://recharts.org/en-US/
npm i recharts@2.8.0

 this component needs the same props as the issue summary component, 
we want to pass three values here
 the number of open in progress and closed issues
 if we want components to be completely independent of each other,
 we can repeat the props instead of sharing them

import { ResponsiveContainer, BarChart, XAxis, YAxis, Bar } from 'recharts';

 we need a data prop to send an array that contains all our data and labels
 then when we pass the bar chart we can pass the data
const data = [
    { label: 'Open', value: open},
    { label: 'In-Progress', value: inProgress},
    { label: 'Closed', value: closed}
];
  return (
    <Card>
      <ResponsiveContainer width='100%' height={300}>
        <BarChart data={data}></BarChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>
    </Card>
  );
 label the x-axis like this <XAxis dataKey="label" />
label the bar  <Bar dataKey="value" fill="#8884d8" />
 it will grab our label property in our data and grab the appropriate value
 rechart requires that we use the client directive

 to make the bars thinner, set the bar size to 60
 normally we could set fill to change the color
 in this case we want to match our accent color so use Style
style={{ fill: 'var(--accent-9)' }}
