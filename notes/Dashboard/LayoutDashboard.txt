Layout the dashboard
 layout in a grid  with two columns, and one column on mobile
 when we repeat our props on issue chart and issue summary, we could extrapolate that to a single source

    <Grid columns={{ initial: '1', md: '2' }} gap="5">
      <Flex direction="column" gap="5">
        <IssueSummary open={open} inProgress={inProgress} closed={closed} />
        <IssueChart open={open} inProgress={inProgress} closed={closed} />
      </Flex>
      <LatestIssues />
    </Grid>
