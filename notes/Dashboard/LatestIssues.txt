Create a new file called latest issues in the root
  const issues = await prisma.issue.findMany({
    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
    take: 5,
  });
  return (
    <Table.Root>
      <Table.Body>
        {issues.map((issue) => (
          <Table.Row key={issue.id}>
            <Table.Cell>{issue.title}</Table.Cell>
          </Table.Row>
        ))}
      </Table.Body>
    </Table.Root>

 we can Style the last five with next links and flex columns to show the badge
 in another Flex  between to include the user profile picture on the right
 in order to get the Avatar,  we have to fetch that with our issues
 in the query, include a include object
 include: {
        assignedToUser: true,
    }
 once we include the property, it'll be included in our issue objects
 so we can call issue.assignedToUser && ( <Avatar src={issue.assignedToUser.image!} fallback='?' size='2' radius='full' />)

 we can wrap the whole table in a card component
 and add a heading
