Add login and logout links
 eventually we will want a user picture with a drop-down menu, but for now this is the simplest part we can work on
Go to navbar
 use the session hook that comes from next-auth/react
 gives us access to the current authentication session
 call it, get the result, the destructure it
 grab two properties 
status - which can be authenticated/unauthenticated/loading
Data -  which we will rename to session,  get the current user's name email and image
const {status, data: session } = useSession();

 create a box underneath the links in our nav bar, and we should dynamically render a link if they're signed in or signed out
  <Box>
        {status === 'authenticated' && (
          <Link href="/api/auth/signout">Log out</Link>
        )}
        {status === 'unauthenticated' && (
          <Link href="/api/auth/signin">Login</Link>
        )}
  </Box>

 use session must be wrapped in a session provider
 the provider is a component that uses react context to pass the authentication session down our component tree
 to use this properly we need to wrap it inside our custom client component ( refer to part one)
Create a new folder in app called auth with a Provider.tsx 
rafce- call it AuthProvider
  add the props children and annotate it with props with children
import React, { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'


const AuthProvider = ({children}: PropsWithChildren) => {

 wrap the children with a session provider
<SessionProvider>{children}</SessionProvider>;

 import the used client directive to make it a client component
 go back to the layout and wrap everything in the body element with our AuthProvider
