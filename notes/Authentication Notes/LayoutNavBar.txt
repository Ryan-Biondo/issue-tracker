Layout NavBar
 we want to separate our login links to the right
 inside the nav bar will add a flex container with two children
justify-content: space between
 remove these Tailwind styles from the nav so that we can apply them with the flex instead using radix UI 
flex space-x-6  items-center

  <Flex>
        <Flex></Flex>
        <Box></Box>
      </Flex>

 before we had applied a height to our snap element, Now we will apply py-3 to give vertical padding
Style the flex container, align will keep out image in the center as well
 <Flex justify="between">
        <Flex align="center" gap="3">

 wrap everything inside the nav bar in a <Container> to maintain max width with the app
