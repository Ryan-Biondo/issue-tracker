We need to configure an adapter so when someone logs into nextauth will store their information in our database
 go to the adapters page for next auth
https://next-auth.js.org/adapters
 use the Prisma adapter
npm install @prisma/client @auth/prisma-adapter 
npm install prisma --save-dev

 we will use an older version npm i @next-auth/prisma-adapter@1.0.7
 we already have Prisma in our project
Copy the imports

import { PrismaAdapter } from "@auth/prisma-adapter" (change to next)
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
Add a constant to hold prisma 
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

Add the adapter above the providers
adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
 providers: [
…
 ],

 now we need to grab the models for storing users and their accounts and add them in our Prisma schema file (in nextauth docs)
 anything that says model
 once pasted into the Prisma schema file, create a migration to sync database with models

npx prisma migrate dev

 when we use an adapter, next auth changes the session strategy from JWT to database  but database strategy doesnt work with oauth providers like google
session: {
strategy: ‘jwt’
}
(worked for me though, and worked both ways)
 clear the cookies in the application tab of the dev tools

Refresh tables in db to see update
