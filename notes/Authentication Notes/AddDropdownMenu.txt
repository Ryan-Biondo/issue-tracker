 if someone is logged in we want to show the user's Avatar, 
when we click it, we want to have a drop-down menu
 where you can see the users email and log out link

 instead of rendering the log out link we will render the drop-down menu
 we can use a drop-down menu from Radix UI
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/dropdown-menu
 start with the root, inside the root we add a trigger

 in our case the trigger will be the user Avatar, import Avatar from radix
src={session.user!.image!}

 it needs a source, and we get the users image
 typescript is concerned that user can be undefined but we know that it is defined because it's authenticated so we add an !

 We get an error saying type string or null or undefined is not assignable to type string or undefined -  because the image property can possibly be null
 using the Google Authentication it is safe to assume that everyone has an automatic value here so we can also use an ! mark here

 we should also include a fallback to display if the user doesn't have an image
fallback='?'
 we can change the size of the Avatar by setting the size prop
 could also use the radius property to make it look round and set radius to full

 add a content block
Add a label that includes {session.user!.email}
Wrap it inside a Text component from radix, Set size to 2

 it's currently not clear that our avatars clickable 
go to the Avatar and set class name to cursor-pointer
 below the label create a drop-down menu item and move the link
