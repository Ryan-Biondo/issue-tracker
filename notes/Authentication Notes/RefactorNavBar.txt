 refactor the code to be more readable and maintainable in the nav bar

Expand selection shortcut alt+shift+right arrow
 we can create subcomponents within the file

Ctrl shift o to go to symbol in editor
 we can quickly jump around to different components this way
 we can move the conditions outside the drop-down menu and if they are authenticated, return the menu

 add the components into the container so that all you see is the nav bar layout and the separated logic below

 so that we don't have to repeat our nav link logic, create a reusable utility class for representing our nav links
@layer utilities {
  .nav-link {
    @apply text-zinc-500 hover:text-zinc-800 transition-colors;
  }
}

 className={classNames({
              'nav-link': true,
              'text-zinc-900': href === currentPath,
            })}>
