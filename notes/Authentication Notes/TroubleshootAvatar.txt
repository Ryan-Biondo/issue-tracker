 we may receive an error 403 from Google forbidding us from getting the image
(i did not)
 the error says it's referrer policy is strict origin when cross origin 
-  we need to set the avatar to no refer
referrerPolicy=’no-referrer’

 another way to solve this would be the next config object
Specify http header
const nextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'referrer-policy',
            value: 'no-referrer',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};

I had an error that I fixed by removing appearance="light" from out theme in the layout
