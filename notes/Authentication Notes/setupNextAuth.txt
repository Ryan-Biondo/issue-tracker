 add authentication to the project using NextAuth.js
https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example
npm install next-auth
https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#route-handlers-app
 basically we need to go to the API folder create an auth folder 
create a catch-all segment and add our route file

/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth"

const handler = NextAuth({
 ...
})

export { handler as GET, handler as POST }


 when calling nextauth, we have to provide the configuration object
 here we have to set a bunch of properties like provider adapters but we will do this incrementally
 for now let's just set providers to an empty array

 now we go to our EnV file and add two environment variables
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=”long random string”
Use openssl to create a random string
openssl rand -base64 32
