We need the prison schema and extend our models to store the assignment of issues to users
 add a new field to the issue model called assignedToUserId 
String? - optional because it may not be assigned
string type - MySQL maps using varchar 191
for consistency use the db attribute to change the type of underlying column in the db
@db.VarChar(255)

*The only difference between the two is the maximum length of the string that can be stored. 
VARCHAR(191) can store up to 191 characters, while VARCHAR(255) can store up to 255 characters.
- MySQL uses VARCHAR(191) by default because it is more efficient for storing short strings. 
When you use VARCHAR(255), you are reserving 255 bytes of storage for each string, 
even if the string is only 1 character long. 
This can be wasteful, especially if you have a lot of short strings in your database.

 add another field to create the relationship between the issue and the user models
assignedToUser - type User?
@relation()- to add a relationship between 2 models, issue and user
 we can specify What fields should be mapped to the user model
 Fields is what we're taking and references is the target
ctrl+space to see all fields available
 so are assigned to user ID will be mapped to the ID of the user model
fields: [assignedToUserId], references: [id]

 whenever we create a relationship, we need the opposite relationship in the other model
shift +ctrl+o to skip to other objects
in user add assignedIssues of type Issue[] - takes the issue model
*We basically have done this for account and session as well

format the code
npx prisma migrate dev
call it add assigned issues

 this creates a new column in our database called assigned to user ID
