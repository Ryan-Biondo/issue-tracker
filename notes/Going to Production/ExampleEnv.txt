env file should always be hidden from the repo
 but we do want an example in the file so that anyone who does clone it knows what environment variables they need to set
DATABASE_URL=""
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""

 if you do push to repo,  there is a tool called git-filter-repo (or another BFG Repo-Cleaner)
 if you have python on your machine, we can take the get filter repo file and rename it to .py
 add it to the root of the project
run in terminal
python3 git-filter-repo.py –path .env –invert-paths –force
