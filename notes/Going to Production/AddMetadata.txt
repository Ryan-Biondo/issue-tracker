 we've built all of our features, but we need to optimize SEO
 give each page a proper title and description (shows on the tab)
 export a metadata constant, next JS looks for this as the Metadata type from next
 at a minimum we set our title and description 
*but it's also better to add open graph and Twitter properties so people can easily share our content on social media
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Issue Tracker - Dashboard',
  description: 'View a summary of project issues.',
};
 we want this on each page

 on the issue Details page, we want to have dynamic metadata
 we need to have access to a route parameters so we fetch the given ID from the database
export async function generateMetadata({ params }: Props) {
  const issue = await prisma.issue.findUnique({
    where: {
      id: parseInt(params.id),
    },
  });


  return {
    title: issue?.title,
    description: 'Details of issue ' + issue?.id,
  };
}
