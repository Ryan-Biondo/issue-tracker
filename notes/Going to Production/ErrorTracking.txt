Set up error tracking and monitoring
 we don't know what errors people might encounter  once it's in production
Sentry, BugSnag, LockRocket

 go to sentry.io
 create a new project
 run npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
 this sets up  listeners for the errors
 you can then see your errors in Century pull up time and all kinds of other data like version environment location, os

sentryy doesn't just track bugs, you can also create teams and assign bugs
 we don't need  the example page and the example route  so delete it before pushing
