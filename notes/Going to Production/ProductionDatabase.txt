 before we can deploy production, we need to set up our production database
 we need in MySQL provider. We can use PlanetScale
has a free tier for 1 db
https://app.planetscale.com/
 start with an empty database
 choose Prisma as the framework for the database
 we already have Prisma installed, we just need the database URL
- for the env in vercel

 once the database is running, we can deploy to vercel
