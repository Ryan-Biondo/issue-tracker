single responsibility principle (SRP)
 our software entities should have a single responsibility
 if you're building a function, class hook, component, page -  should all have one responsibility
 code will be much cleaner this way
 the software but will be easier to maintain and extend

 pages should have a single responsibility -  layout
“Lay the components out”
 specifically for our Details page it should only be concerned with the layout of the grid
 the details of an issue should be moved into a separate component
 same with our edit button logic -neither are the responsibility of the page

In the [id] folder - add a new file called EditIssueButton
 it is not a reusable component across the whole page it is only used here
 move the edit button here and add all missing Imports
 manually move the import of the pencil icon

 this component needs to know the id of the issue to edit
 we can give it as a prop
 destructure the prop as issueId
 in this case we don't need to define a separate interface
 we have a single property
 Define it in line as issueID of type number
 now replace issue.id with issueId
 add the edit issue button in the detail page and import it
 pass the issueId={issue.id}

 create a new component called the issue details
 move everything from the first box here, add all missing Imports
 may have to manually move text
 wrap everything in a fragment

2 options:  fetch the issue in the component or in the page
 if this is the only place where we need the issue it makes more sense to fetch it in the component
 in some situations you may want to fetch it in the page and pass it to various components as props

 add the issue as a prop in the component
Destructure it, grab the issue property
 and we can Define it entirely in line and do structure props as issue of type Issue
 this issue type is defined in our Prisma client when we created the model
 every time we do a migration Prisma generates these types based on our models

Organize Imports
 import the issue details component
 set the prop to the issue that we fetch on the page
issue={issue}
Alt+shift+o organize imports

 now whenever there needs to be an edit 
 there's a clear distinction of where to work on and it's not connected to everything else at once
