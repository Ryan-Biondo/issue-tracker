 now that the API is built, we're ready to update an issue
 go to the issue form
 first check if there's an issue or not which we've passed to this component
 in the try block, after setting submitting to true
If (issue) we want to send a patch request instead of a post request
 call axios.patch the URL is /api/issues/ and concatenate issue.id
 after , include the data that is in the form of data in the body of the request
 Await it 
 otherwise if we don't have an issue send a post request - else

 the button label needs to be set in dynamically 
 if we have an issue set it to update issue otherwise submit new issue
 react should provide a white space for us
 test the implementation
 we may not see the update due to a caching issue, this can be fixed with a refresh
