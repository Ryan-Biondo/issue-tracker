improve the loading experience
 the first time we load our  new issues page it uses our loading skeleton, 
but if we refresh or navigate back to it,  it loads the pieces as they come in
 this happens because we load the editor dynamically - lazy loading
 to solve this we need to load the entire form dynamically so they appear together

 in our new issues page,  we're going to take away our import from the components statically
 we're going to import Dynamic from next/dynamic
 create a constant called issue form called dynamic
 first argument pass a loader function, call import, go to the root @/app/issues/components/IssueForm
 then set SSR to false for our editor

 now we don't need to render simple mde dynamically in the issue form
 so remove the dynamic import and import simple mde
 to make sure that the skeletons load in properly, we add a loading property to loading â€¦
Test

 we're going to move our loading file to a separate reusable component in the _components folder
 create a new file called issue form skeleton
 paste the skeleton logic and get the import for our skeleton
 import it and Export it in our loading file
export { default as IssueFormSkeleton } from '../_components/IssueFormSkeleton';
 now instead of rendering a paragraph We can render the component

 we need the same loading Skeleton on our edit issue page
 currently there is no loading file set and it still using the loading file from its parent
 we get an error because we are not loading this component dynamically
 remove the static import for our form and create a dynamic import
