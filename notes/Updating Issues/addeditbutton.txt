Implement the future to update the issues
 first we need an edit button
 so we need to add a grid layout to the issue detail page
 position the button in a second column
 we can add more buttons in this column
 the focus of this first chunk will be only to create the button and style the page

 in The Details page replace div with the grid from Radix UI
 set the columns prop to “2” -  must pass a string value

 we need two children for the grid - one for each column
 wrap everything inside the grid inside a box from Radix UI
 then we can create a new box
 add a Button from radix inside with ‘edit issue’ label

 once we have the button, if we check responsiveness it looks squished
 so on mobile devices we want a single column
 under Radix UI themes, look at breakpoints
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/breakpoints
 there are sizes here, and instead of passing a number we can pass one of these sizes
columns={{ initial: “1”, md: “2” }}

 now we have a responsive layout but currently the boxes are so close to each other 
we can apply a gap in the grid to separate the boxes
gap=”5”

 in order to add an icon to the button we can use Radix UI
But we have to install another package
npm i @radix-ui/react-icons
https://www.radix-ui.com/icons
 import a pencil2icon from Radix UI/icons
 add the icon in front of the edit issue label

 wrap our label in a link from next/link
 given an href that's an object template literal
/issues/${issue.id}/edit
