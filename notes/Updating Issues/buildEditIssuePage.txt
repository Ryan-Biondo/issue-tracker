 build the edit page
 in the ID folder create a new folder called edit
 at a page file  and create a react component called edit issue page
 this Page is identical to the new issue page 

so grab the new issue page and we will put it into a reusable component
In the issue folder because itâ€™s only used here
 create a components folder in the issues folder for components for the issues section only
 create a new file called issueform.tsx and paste the code
 earlier we defined a type within the code called issue form, rename it to issue form data
 rename new issue page to issue form and where we refer to the schema

 we can prefix the component folder name with an _ so that it is not a part of the routing system
 this is a good technique for separating implementation details from our routing folders

 go to the new issue page and reuse the component
 rafce a new component and call it new issue page
 return an issue form 
- test if it works if so build the edit page

go to the page and import issue form
 to use this form, we have to fetch the given issue and populate the form with that issue
 add an interface for capturing route parameters
 add the params property as an object with id of type string
 add the props to the arrow function

 just like the issue detail page, we have to use Prisma to fetch the issue with the given ID
Call prisma.issue.findUnique({})
 set where to an object with ID set to parse int of  params.id
 await the call to get an issue constant and make the function async

 if the issue doesn't exist we should redirect the user to the not found page
if (!issue) notFound()  from next navigation
 otherwise return the issue form and pass the prop issue

pass issue to the component
 back to the issue form, create an interface Props
 with an issue of type issue from Prisma, import it
 the issue is optional because we only need it for the edit page
 this is one line and we can Define it in the issue form argument in one line

 if we do have an issue, we need to use it to populate the form fields
 in the text field for the title, add a default value prop of issue?.title
 in the controller component, at a default value of issue?.description
