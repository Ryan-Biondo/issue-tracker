
HTTP server response codes are used to indicate the success or failure of an HTTP request. 


They are divided into five classes:

1xx Informational: The request is being processed.
2xx Successful: The request was successful.
3xx Redirection: The client needs to take further action to complete the request.
4xx Client Error: The client made a bad request.
5xx Server Error: The server failed to fulfill the request.


Here are some of the most common server response codes:

200 OK: The request was successful.
400 Bad Request: The request was invalid.
401 Unauthorized: The client is not authorized to access the resource.
403 Forbidden: The client is authorized to access the resource, but forbidden from doing so.
404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unavailable.


Other server response codes include:

301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
302 Found: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new location.
304 Not Modified: The requested resource has not been modified since the last time it was requested.
405 Method Not Allowed: The requested method is not supported for the requested resource.
406 Not Acceptable: The client has requested a format that the server cannot provide.
413 Payload Too Large: The request payload is too large.
429 Too Many Requests: The client has made too many requests in a short period of time.
502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
