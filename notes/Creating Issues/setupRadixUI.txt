We are going to build our 'new issue' page with Radix UI 'themes'
- popular component library
radix-ui.com
radix has 2 flavors 
radix themes - fully styled components
radix primitives - unstyled components, only behavior

https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/overview/getting-started
npm install @radix-ui/themes

in our root layout or wherever
import '@radix-ui/themes/styles.css';
import { Theme } from '@radix-ui/themes';
and wrap everything inside the body element with <Theme></Theme>

to verify this is setup properly
 - create a button in the issues page
 import { Button } from '@radix-ui/themes';
should create a styled button
