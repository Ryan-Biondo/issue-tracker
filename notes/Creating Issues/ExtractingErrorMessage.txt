Currently we repeat the styling for our error wherever we need it
we can extract this markup and reuse it

add a new folder in app called components
make a new file called ErrorMessage.tsx

rafce
typically we would define an interface
    - with a property of children of type ReactNode
    - add props to the argument
    - structure to grab children

*INSTEAD we can use a special interface already defined in react called PropsWithChildren
    - import from react
    - no need for interface

return (
    <Text color="red" as="p">
            {children}
    </Text>
)

Then we can replace out Text component with our custom ErrorMessage Component

Can also add the if error exists logic inside here so we dont repeat that either
if (!children) return null

we still pass our original variables which pass down from children
now title may be undefined so we can pass in the compiler by using optional chaining

also edit the description component
