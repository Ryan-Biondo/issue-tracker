Store issues in our database 
- create a prisma model
define a new model (model Issue)
make sure naming is singular and PascalCase
- define the properies our issues will need
ex. id name of property
Int type
@id id attribute to specify this is an id column
@default to give it a default value
(autoincrement()) - database engine auto assigns an id

strings by default have a max of 191 chars in mysql
- override default value by accessing db @db.
VarChar(255)
set to Text instead for very long inputs

enum - a set of constant values supported in MySQL (NOT all db)
Issues will have a status which can be 1 of 3 values open inprogress and closed
- can use an enum to represent the data
enum Status { - all caps
    OPEN
    IN_PROGRESS
    CLOSED
}
then you can set a properties type to the enum Status @default(OPEN)

DateTime - type for time @default(now()) - stamps when created
@updatedAt - triggers on update

then run npx prisma format to fix
npx prisma migrate dev - name something like create issue model
on 1st migrate prisma creates a migrate folder with subfolders for each migrate
- inside are sql instructions for creating or updating our models

In workbench, Create a connection with the same name as project
- not sure about workbench and datagrip differences
