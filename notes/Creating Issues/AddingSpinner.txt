To improve UX add a spinner to the button when submitting
tailwind elements spinner
https://tw-elements.com/docs/standard/components/spinners/

<div
  class="inline-block h-8 w-8 animate-spin rounded-full border-4 border-solid border-current border-r-transparent align-[-0.125em] motion-reduce:animate-[spin_1.5s_linear_infinite]"
  role="status">
  <span
    class="!absolute !-m-px !h-px !w-px !overflow-hidden !whitespace-nowrap !border-0 !p-0 ![clip:rect(0,0,0,0)]"
    >Loading...</span
  >
</div>

ctrl+d to select next
ctrl+shift+l select all occurences

Create a Spinner.tsx in the components folder
rename class to className
add spinner to button
change height and width to 4 to shrink
could change size but that would be over kill
can edit thickness by changing size of the border

*FOCUS ON EXISTING PROBLEMS AS OPPOSED TO PROBLEMS THAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN

We only want to show while we are submitting 
 - create a state variable in the page
   - isSubmitting, setSubmitting
 -     try {
            setSubmitting(true); - (trying,/submitting)
            ...
          } catch (error) {
            setSubmitting(false); - (failed)
            ...
          }
 - then we can say {isSubmitting && <Spinner />}

It is good practice to disable the submit botton while submitting so the user doesnt submit twice
*especially important with money
so we can add to the Button properties disabled={isSubmitting}
