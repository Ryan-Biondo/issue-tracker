we can easily customize out theme in Radix
use the Theme Panel Component
can use it to preview colors, then copy the theme code
remove themepanel when finished

earlier we set our font to inter, but radix changed it to default
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/typography#with-nextfont
basically it needs us to set a custom variable to our old font
variable: '--font-inter'
on wherever we set our font
className={inter.variable}

modify/create a theme-config.css
.radix-themes {
  --default-font-family: var(--font-inter);
}
import the file in our root layout

NOTE: Font change didn't work after troubleshooting in 2.0 or older
order of imports didnt help
*We are not reading the variable some how 
- we are still using var(--default-font-family) from .radix-themes
- when we disable --default-font-family it reverts to inter
- look for fix later
