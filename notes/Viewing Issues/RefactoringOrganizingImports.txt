techniques for cleaning up code
 clean up tests like delays and command logs
Alt+shift+o for organize imports

 in the issues page
 we can combine these two statements into a single line
import IssueStatusBadge from '../components/IssueStatusBadge';
import Link from '../components/Link';

 go into the components folder and create a new index file 
- for exporting components in the folder
 index.ts
 inside, import the components
 and Export them individually in curly braces as named exports 
now we can import everything from index @/app/components
 because it's named index, we don't have to write the path

 instead of importing and exporting individually
 we can export default as the named component from its location all in one line
export { default as Link } from’./Link’;

 go to the Loading file of the issue detail page
 every time we import the skeletons, we need two lines, 
we can reduce that into a separate module
 back in the components folder add a skeleton.tsx
 give it the two Imports and export default 
 then import it like we do the rest in our index

 now we can load the skeleton like everything else in the components
 replace the Imports in the other two loading pages and organize Imports
