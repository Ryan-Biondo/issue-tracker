To view our issues on the issue page, we need to use prisma to access our db

in the IssuesPage component
import prisma from our client
go to issue and call findMany()
then await the call to get the issues
const issues = prisma.issue.findMany()
make the component async

Next we need to add a table for the data below the button
RadixUI has a table component
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/table
create a Table.Root, inside we need a header and body
in the header create a row with 3 column header cells
issue, status, created

then in the body, we map our issues
map each issue to a table row
First, set the key to issue.id
inside each row create 3 cells: issue.title issue.status issue.createdAt.toDateString()
{issues.map(issue => (
    <Table.Row key={issue.id}></Table.Row>
) )}

Table.Root has a prop called variant
if we set variant="surface" get a nice grey heading and round borders

button is too close to table so give it some bottom margin
wrap it in a div mb-5

on mobile the text looks squished and we want to hide the extra column data
so in column header cell use tailwind
hidden by default and shows on medium devices
hidden is equivilent to display: none
add a className='hidden md:table-cell'

Then add status under the title only for mobile
add a div inside title cell
{issue.status}
className='block md:hidden'
