create additional loading skeletons
 currently we only see a loading message
 now that we have styled the detail page - set the loading page to look just like it

 copy and paste our code in the loading file
 import the missing import statements
 replace the div with a box component from Radix UI for consistency (renders a div)

 replace heading with a skeleton
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton
 grab the import statements for the component and CSS
 replace the issue status badge with a skeleton
 give it a custom width of <Skeleton /> to make it feel like the badge
 replace the date with a  skeleton with 8rem
 replace the markdown with a skeleton with count={3} to create 3
 apply a max-w-xl to the Box
Alt+shift+o to organize imports

Apply a delay from delay  to test delay(2000)

 we need to do the same thing for the  new issue page
 import skeleton and the CSS file
  create a box and apply a max-w-xl
 Inside the Box we need two skeletons one for title and one for description
 to make the second skeleton thicker we can set its height to 20rem
* we get an error but we will return to that when we disable server-side rendering
