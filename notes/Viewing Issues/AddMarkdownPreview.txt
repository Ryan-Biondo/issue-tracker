The markdown editor we have only renders the markup as plain text currently
if we test with a heading italics bullets, we dont get proper styles in the detail page

we need to install a package for previewing markdown content
npm i react-markdown@8.0.7
import ReactMarkdown
replace the p in the Car with a ReactMarkdown

this uses classes like h1, and li
- unstyled by default in tailwind
- we need to install a plugin for Tailwind called Typography
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
install as a development dependency
import the plugin in the tailwind config
 plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography')]

To use this we need to add the prose class to the containing element
give Card className='prose'
and add a mt='4' bc it's close to the top
