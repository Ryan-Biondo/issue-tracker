  we have an error from simple MDE
simple mde is a client side component because we have user interaction
 if we comment out the markdown editor we can see the error go away

 all components in xjs are initially rendered on the server
 Navigator is a browser API, not available on the server - why we get the error
 it is necessary to disable SSR as part of lazy loading client side components

 remove the import to simple mde
 instead we import the dynamic function from next/dynamic
 then we dynamically load the component - this is called lazy loading
 create a constant calls the same thing as our component we're trying to dynamically render
 in this case simple mde 
 assign it to a dynamic function and give it a loader function
 import the react simple mde editor
 an configureation object will be the second argument of the dynamic function
 set SSR to false -  tells next JS not to render this component on the server
