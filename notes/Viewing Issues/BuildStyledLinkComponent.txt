 currently it's not clear that the title of the issues are clickable
 they look identical to Creation dates, unless we hover over them
 let's improve the styling of our links

 go to the list of issues
 one option is to give it a couple of Tailwind classes
 text-violet-600 hover:underline
 this approach is not ideal bc we have to apply the same classes to every link
 we could create a CSS class that reuses in every link
 but if we update our  Radix theme, we'll need to also come back and change the color of the links

a better approach is to create a link component to reuse from Radix
 colors based on the accent of the theme
https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/link
 replace the link from next JS with the one from Radix - replace imports
* but Radix UI doesn't  provide us client side navigation
- so we need to create a custom component that combines the link from next and Radix UI

 add a new component in the components folder called link.tsx
 import the link component from next/link
 we can rename link from next navigation to NextLink for clarity
 can do the same from radix-ui/themes
{Link as RadixLink}

 the link component needs a few props href and children
 Define an interface called props and give it two properties
 href of type string
Children of type string
pass the props and destructure href and children right away as type props

 return to next link so we get client side navigation
Set href to {href}
 then at the radix link inside for styling
add the label {children} inside the tags

 back to the issues page we can replace link import with our custom one
 we need two props in order for next to pass the information properly
passHref legacyBehavior
